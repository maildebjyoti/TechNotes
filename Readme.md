There's no person in earth who has a memory as bad as mine. I find it very difficult to remember anything, even the things which I happen to read a few days back. So here I came up with an idea to jot down all my notes which I think might be useful, interesting and most importantly a quick note/placeholder from where I can copy paste commands when ever necessary. I have started working on these notes and it might take a while before it gains some volume and gain some momentum. But it's never too late.

So the primary objectives of my notes will be as follows -

- Short but yet descriptive
- Sample codes for easy reference
- Architectural diagrams, block diagrams & flow charts where necessary or required
- Handy commands to copy paste
- Interview questions and tips
- Handy tutorial videos/links and other references
- Sharable and worthy enough for bookmark
- and more...

Since the knowledge I gather are mostly from the community so I would like to keep this open for everyone so you too can edit and raise PR. Treat it as your own notes. Let's have a healthy discussion.

There are lot more similar blogs, gits circulating around but you tend to lean towards the things you use most. So feel free to use my blogs and would love to hear from you if it helped you in any way.

Let's go...
